# Introduction

Our REST APIs give all the functionalities needed to interact with our database. All these services are exclusively usable with https standard, and only after having been authenticated.

To get your account, please contact us at [matteo@netzeroinsights.com](mailto:matteo@netzeroinsights.com).

Every endpoint is to be called starting with the domain https://api.netzeroinsights.com

# Security

## Login

> To login, use this code:

```shell
curl -v -X POST "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/formLogin" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your credentials.
> 
> Using the -v ("verbose") flag lets you see the full response, in which you can find the **Session Cookie**.

Before using any other API, you should first login using the following endpoint:

`POST /security/formLogin`

With the following two parameters:

Parameter name | Parameter value
--------- | -----------
username | provided by Net Zero Insights
password | provided by Net Zero Insights

The possible response codes are:

Response code | Meaning
--------- | -----------
200 | Login successful

Please note that in case of a 200 response, you will also get a **Session Cookie**. You should save this,
as it will be needed for using all the other endpoints. The session cookie expires after 30 minutes of
session inactivity.

Our API expects the **Session Cookie** to be included in all API requests to the server, like this:

`JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID</code> with your **Session Cookie**.
</aside>

## Logout

> To logout, use this code:

```shell
curl -v --cookie "JSESSIONID=EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID" \
 -X GET "https://api.netzeroinsights.com/security/logout"
```

> Make sure to replace `EXAMPLE_SESSION_ID` with your **Session Cookie**

To close the session, you should use the following endpoint:

`GET /security/logout`

It takes no parameter, and has the following response code:

Response code | Meaning
--------- | -----------
200 | Session terminated

<aside class="notice">
Please note that manually closing a session is not required, since it will be closed bye the server after
30 minutes. This endpoint is mainly used if you need to use different accounts.
